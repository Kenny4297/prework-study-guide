# prework-study-guide

## This project will be used to review the material I have learned in Prework Camp

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is a blueprint for any study materials I have learned during Prework Camp. Discipline built this project, not motivation, since motivation is not a good strategy for success. It solves the problem of scattered notes and puts them all in one place for easy review. 

I learned a few things while building this project. I had never used and pushed a branch (other than 'master') to github, and it was a struggle learning the minute differences between pushing the master and pushing a branch to GitHub.
